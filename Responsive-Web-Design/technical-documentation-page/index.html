          SSH, or Secure Shell is a network protocol that allows a user to
          securely interact with another machine over a network.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different ways people can authenticate with an SSH server. A
          common example would be to authenticate with a password. SSH Keys are
          an alternative to password based authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          SSH Keys are a form of key based authentication. Key based
          authentication works to authenticate the user using a system that
          involves a set of keys, a public key, and a private key. The private
          key is kept with only the user, while the public key can be given
          freely. The private key is then used to prove the user's identity, and
          authenticate. You can read more about it

        <p>SSH keys are preferred over using a password.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The first reason is that they are harder to hack and more secure
              than passwords. With keys, the private key is never sent to the
              server, while a password is sent to the server in order to
              authenticate. SSH key's are much harder to brute force than
              passwords when configured correctly, and are generated by the
              computer instead of by the user. This however does not mean that
              using an SSH key will make you unhackable, you still want to take
              care of your private key and make sure that the contents of the
              private key are not exposed, as if an attacker knows your private
              key, they can authenticate as you.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The second reason is that they are also more convenient to use.
              While they may be more complex to setup, they are much easier to
              use on a daily basis than typing in a password every time to
              authenticate. This is as with an SSH key, you don't need to enter
              a password, although you may choose to optionally include a
              password as well. The private key is typically sent automatically,
              which saves time from typing or from copying a password from a
              password manager.

        <header><h2>Generating SSH keys</h2></header>
        <p>
          First, we need to generate our ssh key. Before we can do so, we need
          to have OpenSSH installed. This tutorial assumes that you are running
          a linux distribution with apt as a package manager. Note that OpenSSH
          will normally come by default in most distributions. If we don't have
          it for some reason, we can do install it by running:
        </p>
        <code class="codeline">$ sudo apt install openssh</code>
        <p>From here, we can generate our key.</p>
        <code class="codeline">$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519</code>
        <p>
          This will generate a ssh key. The
          <code class="codetext">-t</code> indicates what type of algorithm
          should be used. In this case, it's
          <code class="codetext">ed25519</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          ed25519 is considered the best algorithm to use by general consensus,
          but it may not be available on legacy machines. In this case, you can
          run:
        </p>
        <code class="codeline">$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</code>
        <p>This uses RSA, with a bit size of 4096.</p>
        <p>After this, you can run this to add the key to the ssh-agent.</p>
        <code class="codeline">$ ssh-add</code>

      <section id="setting_up_ssh_keys_on_a_server" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Setting up SSH keys on a server</h2></header>
        <p>
          From here, you also may want to add the SSH key to an SSH server. To
          do this, you want to run:
        </p>
        <code class="codeline">$ ssh-copy-id username@example.com</code>
        <p>and then login to the server with the username and password.</p>
        <p>
          From here, you no longer need your password to login, and can just
          login with the key. You can also disable password authentication
          completely, which will be covered under the next section.

          There are other configuration settings you can change to harden an SSH
          server.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              First, you need to open the sshd configuration with a text editor:
            </p>
            <code class="codeline">$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Next, we can find the area in the configuration that says</p>
            <code class="codeline">PermitRootLogin yes</code>
            <p>And change it to <code class="codetext">no</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Lastly, as we have already setup SSH keys, we want to disable
              logging in with a password. We do this by setting
            </p>
            <code class="codeline">PasswordAuthentication yes</code>
            <p>And change it to <code class="codetext">no</code></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
