# Technical Documentation Page

Technical Documentation Page about SSH Keys. I initially thought this one was going to be quite boring but it ended up being very rewarding. I had to use a few tricks to add a hamburger menu while keeping it CSS+HTML only. Some of the content on this page might not be entirely accurate as I myself learned part of it while writing.
